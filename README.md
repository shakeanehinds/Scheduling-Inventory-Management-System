# Inventory Management and Scheduling System 
I created this system to solve a problem with one of the sport commitees at school who were having issues keeping track of inventory,  student athletes and scheduling them for training.


*This system requires a databse to store and retrieve information, a localhost server was used to achieve this
*backend needs to be updated to create and display schedules based on data stored in server
*checkboxes on front end are not yet coded to send values to databse. (each checkbox should represent one hour in secs, ie 3600), calculations will then be done one the backend to display the amount of hours each student trains for each day and the timeslot based on their input.
